# hello-world

Hello - 

My name is Joel, and I live in Dallas, TX. I work in insurance, but in my free time I enjoy cooking, working out and learning more about data science. 
I'm currently starting my 3rd course in a data science program, and I look forward to learning more about applying R to statistics.
